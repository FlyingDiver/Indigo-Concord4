- Handle multiple partitions
- Create way to send synthetic events (e.g. alarms) into plugin for testing
- Handle alarm events.  This includes cancels & restorals
- Handle arming level and map to partitions.  
- when restarting plugin, close serial port if already open ????
- properly handle comm error, e.g. serial port device goes away and tx/rx fails" put panel and devices in correct error state
- flush input & output on opening
- fix panel info handling (get serial / rev numbers right)
- TCP proxy that speaks 'Concord' (AD2USB ser2sock?)pl
- create new event - 'PROXY TROUBLE'  that the proxy can send to the plugin!
- Keep alive
- Fix zone text handling: spaces, backspace, sentence case
X - fixup zone states: unknown, tripped, OK, problem
- comm loop: be greedy about reading data before sending any; think panel doesn't want to deal with incoming messages while it is waiting for acks on outgoing
X - Debug mode handling / log levels
- split out the two lines for LCD display
- Detect '*' in LCD output; expose to Indigo (but would this only tell us something we could find out from another query -- e.g. if it's * but that's only because windows are open, then who cares; how to detect other issues on top of that?)  AD2USB had bug with sending '*', perhaps we have same big although different devices?
- Email reporting of what's open, closed; pick zones that can be open at night.
- thread safety for message handlers poking around in zone/partition data structures


Handling config and config changes:
- Not sure about how to parameterize a new zone dev when we have no panel info; seems to come up with 'zeros' as zone/part id; what about if we edit a configuration for an existing zone dev? 
- XXX use props or state to hold zone config info?  If props, how to get zone/part visible to user.  Answer: 'address' field.  OK.  So revamp how startComm/stopComm work...
- Can a zone/partition device change its config while active?  (i.e. after startComm but before stopComm)?
- deviceUpdated()?



Bigger:
- integrate with Honey?
- generic alarm plugin?

Models:
- Cynical Honey
- Caddx
- AD2USB -- also for Honeywell, like Cynical
- DSC
