- when restarting plugin, close serial port if already open ????
- flush input & output on opening
- TCP proxy that speaks 'Concord' (AD2USB ser2sock?)pl
- create new event - 'PROXY TROUBLE'  that the prxy can send to the plugin!
- Keep alive
- Fix zone text handling: spaces, backspace, sentence case
- fixup zone states: unknown, tripped, OK, problem
- comm loop: be gredy about reading data before sending any; think panel doesn't want to deal with incoming messages while it is waiting for acks on outgoing
X - Debug mode handling / log levels
- split out the two lines for LCD display
- Handle multiple partitions
- Detect '*' in LCD output; expose to Indigo (but would this only tell us something we could find out from another query -- e.g. if it's * but that's only because windows are open, then who cares; how to detect other issues on top of that?)  AD2USB had bug with sending '*', perhaps we have same big although different devices?

- Structure: connect Panel device to serial port, or plugin?

Bigger:
- integrate with Honey
- generic alarm plugin?

Models:
- Cynical Honey
- Caddx
- AD2USB -- also for Honeywell, like Cynical
- DSC
